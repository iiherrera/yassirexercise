<h1>Notes</h1>

- API key must be entered in Constants.swift
- UI and usability can be improved and features (like infinite scroll, paging, searching, filtering, etc) added. But I wanted to make it clean and simple.
- I used the MVVM design pattern with SwiftUI
- Target is iOS 15, as right now it is usually what we support from (Latest minus 2)
- I wrote Unit Tests for MoviesViewModel and MovieDetailViewModel
